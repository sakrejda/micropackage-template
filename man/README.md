These files are autogenerated, do not edit manually it's a lost cause.

To generate these files:

1) Add roxygen2-compatible comments on the functions, here's an example:

```
#' This function makes rocks
#'
#' By harnessing the power of the sun (a global variable)
#' this function creates approximately spherical rocks for you.
#'
#' @param r radius of the approximate sphere in meters
#' @param h hardness index of the rock, in Mohs hardness units
#' @return a rock
#' @export
make_rock = function(r = 1, h = 1) {
  if (r <= 0)
    stop("The radius of the rock must be a positive number.")
  if (h <= 0)
    stop("This function only makes rocks, not dust.")
  rock = sun$rock_out(r, h)
  return(rock)
}
```
Check the roxygen2 doc for additional options if needed.  The key 
is giving a short description (the first special comment line), 
giving a long description only if necessary (paragraph after the
first line).  Describing the names and meaning of each parameter

2) Run `roxygen2::roxygenize("<path-to-package-root")

3) This should create .Rd files in the `man` subdirectory.

3) Add/commit them to the git repo.

4) Celebrate.
